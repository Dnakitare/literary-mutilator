		<p id="tees">Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. What? We're not at all alike! And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Your head is not an artifact! You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.</p>
		<p>Are you up for promotion? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Sorry, Data. They were just sucked into space. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules.</p>
		<p id="scramble">Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Travel time to the nearest starbase? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?</p>
